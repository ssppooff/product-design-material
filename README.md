# Product Design Materials
In this repository I've uploaded my portfolio I did at the end of my year at the Domus Academy in Milan, which successfully got me an internship at Marco Acerbis Studio.
Additionally, there is my thesis which is based on a project not present in the portfolio. This concept design was the last project I did at Domus Academy and was subsequently expanded into a thesis document and presentation at the very end of the curricular year.
